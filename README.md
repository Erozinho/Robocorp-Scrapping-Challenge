# RPA Challenge - Fresh news 2.0

Starting my first [challenge](https://thoughtfulautomation.notion.site/RPA-Challenge-Fresh-news-2-0-37e2db5f88cb48d5ab1c972973226eb4#5f23b58cf7ef49c4a30cce8c7cebf495) using Robocorp!

## The Challenge
Your challenge is to automate the process of extracting data from a news site.

You should push your code to a **public** Github repo, and then use that repo to a Robocorp Control Room process. The process should have a completed successful run before submission. Make sure to [write your files to the `/output` directory] so that they are visible in the artifacts list.

#### I WILL UPDATE THIS SOON
